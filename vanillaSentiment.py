Vanilla sentiment analysis
Step 1 = Tokenize the data
Step 2 = Set pretrained BERT to learn the sentiment by fine tuning it on reddit/twitter and sentiment social media posts dataset.
No need for train test dev as its pretrained BERT and is less data BERT could use. Already have supervised examples so rather pass more for more accurate fine-tune
